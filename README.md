Detecting and classifying software bugs are vital processes in the software development lifecycle, significantly affecting the quality and dependability of software systems. People can classify bugs, but that is slow and susceptible to error, especially as bugs become ever more complex in the modern age. Automated malfunction classification based on machine learning (ML) is a promising method to overcome those challenges.
Aiming to explore the development of an ML powered bug classification system. Then, it analyzes structured data (like the bug description and logs) and assigns the bug to a predefined category (like functional, security, performance, etc.). The implementation uses tree-based algorithms, specifically Decision Trees and Random Forests for classification and has inbuilt handling for challenges such as class imbalance and scalability.
The repository contains the dataset from jira, program file and the report. To run the project first import the data set using conda or collab and then run the code.
